# object-detection

There is a mess now. Deal with it.
I'm dealing.

### What are here:

As I remember, **minimalistic pack** contains all crusial files for training.
And in **object-detection** can be found different usable things,
such as 
* collected and labeled dataset
* protoc.exe to build tf proto files
* ready folders **data** and **training** in its final form
* even **weights**, but they are not well

Also I have *some kind* of my own **object detection guide**, written far away from formal and literature languge. So, *I do not recommend* read it yet. When I have an opportunity to walk this path again, I'll change it and make it perfect and exemplary.

### Some usefull links:

* [Tensorflow / research / object detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)

As a matter of fact, the heart and the core of this work. 


* [Tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)

Model zoo of tensorflow. Here is used **ssd_mobilenet**.


* [How To Train an Object Detection Classifier for Multiple Objects Using TensorFlow (GPU) on Windows 10](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10/blob/master/README.md)

It is good and clear text tutorial. Helped me a lot.


* [Youtube tutorial from start to end by Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcNK5GeCQnxYnSSaar2tpku)

Some moments needed to be google or investigate, but it is indispensable and super visual guide.
