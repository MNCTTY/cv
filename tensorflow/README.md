There is a mess now. Deal with it.

Some usefull links:

* [Tensorflow / research / object detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)

As a matter of fact, the heart and the core of this work. 


* [Tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)

Model zoo of tensorflow. Here is used **ssd_mobilenet**.


* [How To Train an Object Detection Classifier for Multiple Objects Using TensorFlow (GPU) on Windows 10](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10/blob/master/README.md)

It is good and clear text tutorial. Helped me a lot.


* [Youtube tutorial from start to end by Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcNK5GeCQnxYnSSaar2tpku)

Some moments needed to be google or investigate, but it is indispensable and super visual guide.
